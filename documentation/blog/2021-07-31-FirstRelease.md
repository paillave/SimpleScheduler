After 3 years of hard work and testing, ETL.NET is finally ready for production environment.

<!--truncate-->

Lot of things happened since the last alpha release:

- So many bugs solved!!!
- Every feature that SSIS offers is implemented
- Lot of new features, for example:
  - The fantastic Correlation system to normalize in a snap of a finger a flat file into several tables.
  - A great Connector system for an ETL to have sources and destinations of files changed in seconds by any infrastructure administrator
  - EMail extension to read files from a SMTP or to send emails using embedded metadata of a file
- The library is now the foundation of a generic and advanced batch system for very sensitive data of a financial solution: [FundProcess](https://FundProcess.lu)

I hope this first production ready release will be as appreciated as I appreciated to make it for developers!
